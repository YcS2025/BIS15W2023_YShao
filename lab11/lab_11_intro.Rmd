## Seating & Set-up
1. Please make sure that you sit next to your group members for the rest of the quarter.
2. Please set-up your computer as normal.

## Warm-up
For this warm-up, please use the `heartrate` data. Be sure to label your plots!

1. Make a plot that compares the heartrate of patients for drug a.
```{r}
library("tidyverse")
heartrate<-read.csv("data/heartrate.csv")
heartrate%>%
  pivot_longer(-patient,
               names_to = "Drug",
               values_to = "Heartrate")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=patient,y=Heartrate,fill=patient))+geom_col()
```
2. Make a plot that compares heartrate (as a range) for each drug.
```{r}
heartrate%>%
  pivot_longer(-patient,
               names_to = "Drug",
               values_to = "Heartrate")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Drug,y=Heartrate,fill=Drug))+geom_boxplot()
```
