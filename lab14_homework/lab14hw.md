## Questions

1. Look up 'Data Scientist' at https://www.bls.gov/. What degree is required for this career? Is it a growing occupation?  

To become a Data scientist, you need a Bachelor's degree. It is definitely a growing occupation.

2. How would you describe your data science skills on a resume for a job application? Write a blurb that reflects the skills you have learned in this course. 

I can perform simple analyzes on less complex data and visualize the results with corresponding graphs.

3. What are your current career interests, and how could your R skills support that career path? (hint: this might be good content for your LinkedIn profile ;)

My all time career interest is becoming a genetic scientist. For fields such as genes that are usually accompanied by huge data, r skills are obviously of great help to me in analyzing and organizing data.

4. What about this course has been the most difficult for you? What has been the most rewarding?

For me, the hardest part is judging whether the data is tidy. And the most rewarding thing is undoubtedly that I learned to make apps in r.

5. What do you wish you had known, or what skills do you wish you had, before taking this class.

Part of it is what I learned from this class, and the other part is more advanced and complex analysis of graphical data.

6. If we had 1 more lab in this class, what would you have liked to learn more about?

How to create a 3D histogram group in map form.

7. Now that you have (almost!) completed this course, do you plan to persue further data or computer science skills? What do you plan to do?

I would persue further data and computer science skills. I plan to continue to take courses related to computer science and biological science, especially genetics, in the days to come.

8. How important was working with a partner to your success in this class? If this class were transitioned to an online format, how do you think that would affect your understanding?

I mainly study alone in this course. After assigning peers for the group project, I started to have some discussions with my peers in class, which made up some of my deficiencies in details. If this course were taken online, what I have learned should not be much different from what it is now.

9. Did you complete the class evaluation? Please complete the class evaluation using the link provided in the announcements. Your feedback is very important and we appreciate your time.

Yes
